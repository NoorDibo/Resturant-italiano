      <h2 class="htwo">1.	Consider the roles algorithms play in your daily life, 
              at home, and at work. Confront your reflection with your group. </h2>
        <p class="texts"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" target="_blank" title="Check what that means on Wikipedia">Algorithms</a> affects our daily life every time we use technology like a phone and computer. 
              Given we are IT students, this is most of our day. For example, most of us use Tiktok,
              and experience that the algorithms fuel content based on not only our search engine active activity,
              but a lot of our personal conversations. For example, we send a message about an interest on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord" target="_blank" title="Check what that means on Wikipedia">Discord</a>,
              and almost immediately the Tiktok algorithm will provide us with content about the topic we were talking about on Discord.
              We feel that the main effect of algorithms of our daily life comes based on our social media use – for example,
              when we apply for jobs, we find that suddenly all of our advertisements at all social media platforms surround
              the topic of job searching. We all frequently check the weather predictions, based on algorithms, every single
              day and plan our days around that. One could say that a majority of our life is revolved around the predictions
              of algorithms in that way; the way we dress and what days we plan activities fall under that category.
              At transportation we encounter algorithms when burying tickets, where the Ruter app will recommend you
              tickets that most fit your routines. We also encounter them when we use navigation apps to find how
              we get home, to work or to school as fast and comfortably as possible. At work, one of us encounters
              it while using her shift management app, while another works with algorithms to push their content 
              out to desired audiences (he works in advertisement).</p>
          <h2 class="htwo">2.	If you use social media, log into one of your accounts and have a look at the 
              advertisements. Can you trace them back to web pages you have visited or posts you have interacted 
              with? </h2>
          <p class="texts">All of us have experienced this evenly in the past few days. For one of us, 
              he talked about needing a new dentist and following that conversation he proceeded to get 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising" target="_blank" title="Check what that means on Wikipedia">ads</a> on Facebook about cheap dentist offers in his area. After downloading the mind map app on 
              one of our devices, we found that when we opened Tiktok while discussing, we got an 
              advertisement for a note-taking device. Another group member opened Instagram to a bunch of 
              clothing advertisements after looking for new outfits online the day before. We have found 
              that all of us experience this on several areas of interest, including health, clothing, 
              education and work.</p>
