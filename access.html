        Our intention when making our website, was  to make the site easily accessible and user friendly for everyone.
        We have made legible subpages that everyone can use and a straight-forward booking form.
        When creating the website, we wanted it to look simple and legible.
        We checked the usability of the code on the website:
        <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">
        Validator.</a>
        The automatic test helped us by pointing out some minor errors
        and some potential improvements in the code to make it even more 
        readable. An example of this is that our backgrounds and text did not have enough contrast between them, and as a result we made our backgrounds darker. We wanted to use as little code as possible so as not 
        to lag the page. We placed the footer and header on a subpage
        named index.css and the rest of the subpages had their own 
        legible subpages.Here are pictures of what the website testing looks like and how it helped us:</p>
        <br>
        <p id="textacc">To test our code, we used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">Validator</a> web accessibility tool. After importing the code, Validator showed us that though our webpage is well-designed, it has some room for improvement. When we began designing our webpage, we were intent on designing an easily accessible webpage, usable by all, and therefore we heeded the warnings given to us by Validator. 
            We were made aware of our lack of contrast between background colours/pictures and our text-colour choice, which was white. As we had used text-shadowing on our text, we felt it was visible, but as Validator pointed out to us, this might not be entirely visible to sight-reduced users. Therefore, we made the background much darker, so our text would pop more. We also scaled the colour of the interactive options/buttons on screen. 
            We also got an alert about redundant links, as we have a navbar linking to the same pages as buttons on our index page. This is a conscious choice, as we feel this makes our page easier to use, as you will be able to find our menu and booking page regardless of where your eyes are drawn on the page. Considering this, we believe our page is now a very user friendly and universally accessible webpage, designed for everyone.
