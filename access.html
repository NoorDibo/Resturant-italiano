        <p id="textacc">To test our code, we used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">Validator</a> web accessibility tool. After importing the code, Validator showed us that though our webpage is well-designed, it has some room for improvement. When we began designing our webpage, we were intent on designing an easily accessible webpage, usable by all, and therefore we heeded the warnings given to us by Validator. 
            We were made aware of our lack of contrast between background colours/pictures and our text-colour choice, which was white. As we had used text-shadowing on our text, we felt it was visible, but as Validator pointed out to us, this might not be entirely visible to sight-reduced users. Therefore, we made the background much darker, so our text would pop more. We also scaled the colour of the interactive options/buttons on screen. 
            We also got an alert about redundant links, as we have a navbar linking to the same pages as buttons on our index page. This is a conscious choice, as we feel this makes our page easier to use, as you will be able to find our menu and booking page regardless of where your eyes are drawn on the page. Considering this, we believe our page is now a very user friendly and universally accessible webpage, designed for everyone. Here are pictures of what the website testing looks like and how it helped us:
